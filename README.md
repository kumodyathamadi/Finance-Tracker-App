# Finance-Tracker-App
Excited to share my latest project! I've developed a Finance Tracker App using Shared Preferences, Android Studio, and Kotlin. The app allows users to easily track their income, expenses, and savings, helping them stay on top of their financial goals.

Key Features:

Simple, user-friendly interface
Tracks daily expenses and income
Stores data securely using Shared Preferences
Provides an overview of monthly financial performance

This app is designed to help users manage their finances efficiently and gain better insights into their spending habits. I'm constantly looking to improve and add more features, so feel free to share any feedback or suggestions!
